# LinkXall
LinkXall provides basic functions that are useful in many specific situations but is useful for everyone as a personal information base. This is explained by PersonalKnowledgeBase.txt (or pdf) which you can read online. 

The lxainstall.zip archive contains all of the LinkXall files, including LxaInstall.odt, which describes and automates (with Libre-Basic macros and Python, Bash, and bat scripts) installation and configuration in Linux and Windows. All of the programs are released under GNU General Public License version 3. The archive's doc folder contains LxaUserGuide.odt, which thoroughly describes LinkXall's many unique capabilities. Studying all of these would take a long time. The doc folder also contains LxaTut.odt,  a prescriptive tutorial that relatively quickly demonstrates the most generally useful features. You may want to read one or both of these to help you decide whether the benefits of LinkXall are worth the effort required to learn how to exploit them but to do this you need to download lxainstall.zip and have installed LibreOffice on your computer.
