# LinkXall
The core of LinkXall is a LibreOffice library that improves its hyperlinking between documents and extends it to text files, including scripts and LibreOffice macro libraries. It also has an Emacs library to support this. It also creates a hierarchical document framework with bidirectional hyperlinking between topics and table of contents.
