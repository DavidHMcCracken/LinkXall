# LinkXall
The core of LinkXall is a LibreOffice library that improves its hyperlinking between documents and extends it to text files, including scripts and LibreOffice macro libraries. It also has an Emacs library to support this. It also creates a hierarchical document framework with bidirectional hyperlinking between topics and table of contents. 

lxainstall.zip contains all of the LinkXall files and the LxaInstall.odt document, which describes and automates (with Libre-Basic macros and Python, Bash, and bat scripts) installation and configuration in Linux and Windows. All of the programs are released under GNU General Public License version 3. The archive's doc folder contains LxaUserGuide.odt, whose Introduction topic explains the rationale and features of LinkXall. LinkXall has many unique capabilities and their description in LxaUserGuide would take a long time to read. The doc folder also contains LxaTut.odt, a tutorial that relatively quickly demonstrates the most generally useful features. LxaDesign.odt documents the library and serves as an example of how LinkXall's two-way linking between documents and text files coordinates extensive commenting and design history.
